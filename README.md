# Charisma-Predictor: Multi-Modal AI for Personality & Leadership Assessment

**Charisma-Predictor** is a multimodal AI pipeline developed as part of a Master's research project in Artificial Intelligence at Maastricht University. It received a final grade of **8.5 / 10**, based on methodology, implementation, and evaluation.

This repository contains the parts I personally developed: the **video model**, the **fusion logic**, and the **charisma scoring and visualization**.

## 🚀 Highlights

*   **Video**: facial landmark tracking via MediaPipe + five sequence models (CNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformer, TCN)
*   **Ensemble**: video outputs fused via weighted averaging (best MAE: 0.1189)
*   **Fusion**: weighted averaging and Multi-Channel Weighted Fusion (MCWF)
*   **Output**: Big Five personality prediction + charisma score ∈ \[0, 1], classified into five levels
*   **Optimization**: early stopping, learning rate scheduling (ReduceLROnPlateau)
*   **Visuals**: leadership score distribution, confusion matrices
*   **Achieved** up to **92.45% accuracy** on Big Five prediction via fusion (MCWF)

## 📊 Sample Output

**Leadership Suitability Distribution:**

> The fusion output shows high alignment between predicted and true leadership scores, confirming the effectiveness of cross-modal aggregation.

**Fusion Model Personality Accuracy (MCWF):**

## 👤 My Contribution

This repository reflects my direct contributions to the project:

* Developed the full **video model pipeline**: feature extraction, five-model ensemble, evaluation
* Designed and implemented **fusion logic**, including MCWF and weighted fusion strategies
* Created the **charisma scoring system** using normalized Big Five trait correlations
* Generated final evaluation metrics, plots, and analysis outputs
