## Introduction

In today's world, understanding personality traits and leadership qualities is crucial. The **Charisma Predictor** employs advanced AI techniques to analyze various inputs, including audio, text, and video. By doing so, it predicts personality traits based on the Big Five model and evaluates the charisma of individuals. This project aims to provide insights into personal development, team dynamics, and leadership effectiveness.

## Features

- **Multimodal Analysis**: Combines audio, text, and video data for a holistic assessment.
- **Big Five Personality Prediction**: Accurately predicts traits like openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism.
- **Charismatic Leadership Assessment**: Evaluates leadership qualities based on charisma metrics.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for robust predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for inputting data and viewing results.

## Technologies Used

- **Audio Processing**: Techniques for analyzing voice tone and speech patterns.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Tools for understanding text inputs and extracting meaning.
- **Computer Vision**: Methods for analyzing video and facial expressions.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes frameworks like PyTorch and transformer models for predictions.
- **Mediapipe**: For real-time facial landmark detection.
- **Fusion Models**: Combines data from different modalities for improved accuracy.
